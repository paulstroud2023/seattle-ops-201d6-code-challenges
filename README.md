Ops 201 Code Challenges

This repo is meant to document my progression through the CF Ops 201 course. I'm also using it as an opportunity to showcase the quality of my work, my work ethic, and some sense of humor.

Having done lots of coding and scripting in the past, I haven't learned anything fundamentally new from this course's code assignments. However, this has been a good refresher on my bash/powershell scripting skills - which is important and relevant to my future work in the cybersecurity field.

While I cannot pick just one favorite assignment, I'd say I enjoyed challenges 5, 6, and 7, as well as #13. This was a result of those assignments being more engaging than the rest and allowing more freedom to experiment and build.

If I had the time, I would improve several of these scripts to provide better interactivity, more functionality, and input validation and exception handling.

Many of the scripts in this course have been a good example of scenarios that can be useful in the workplace. Scripts have incredible utility when it comes to automating and standardizing repetitive tasks.
